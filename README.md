# Classification and Clustering based on Machine Learning Approach

This repository consists of two main folders: 
- **project** folder: contain the source code and dataset (Data.csv) for the machine learning project.
- **notes** folder: contain code examples for the usage of Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) related to machine learning, data visualization and etc.

## Introduction

The project aims to classify and cluster students based on their marks from different majors. The provided CSV file (Data.csv) contains student records, including the mark for each question and corresponding student information, which will be used for training the classification and clustering models.

Each record in the CSV file consists of the following columns:

ID: A unique identifier for each student.  
Q1: Mark for question1  
Q2: Mark for question2  
...  
Q5: Mark for question3  
Programme: The major in which the student is enrolled

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, preprocess, and transform the student marks dataset for model training and analysis.
- **Classification:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to classify students into different majors based on their marks.
- **Clustering:** Employ clustering techniques to group students with similar academic performances, enabling pattern discovery.

## Prerequisite
- Python3
- anaconda
